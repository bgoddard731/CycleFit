# CycleFit
Cycle Fit Senior Design Project Application

This android application collects, processes, and presents relevent cycling information to users of the CycleFit system.

The application uses the smartphones existing capability to track location, speed, and distance traveled, then
synchronizes this information with incoming incline, heartrate, and pedal RPM sensor data from the bike-mounted 
cyclefit system.

Route information is displayed to the user through a summary page. The previous 100 summary pages are stored on the device.

Future routes that are planned can be compared to stored summaries to give users an indication of the expected effectiveness
of the upcoming route.
